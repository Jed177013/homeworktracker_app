Simple Python GUI app made using Tkinter library

Nowadays, many students get a lot of assignments and homework they have to do, but, there is not really a proper or convenient way for them to record their work digitally. 

My program will provide a solution to this problem. The program will let the students track and organise their work digitally. 
Their tasks and deadlines would be listed clearly. 
At the same time, the students will be able to maintain environmental sustainability by not using too many papers for recording their work. 

In order for the program to run, the user has to create a virtual environment folder and install the package in this folder. 

Secondly, install the "tkcalendar" module that provides a calendar widget. 
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the tkcalendar module using pip: pip install tkcalendar
